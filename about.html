    <h2>About</h2>
    <img src="images/single-book.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Founded in 1993, Books n' Beans had its humble beginnings as a resale store for outdated college textbooks. As
        its
        cult status in the community grew, so did customer demand for a reliable source of caffeine. Thus, the current
        iteration of Books n' Beans was born.

        We're open 7 days a week, offering impeccable coffee, fine pastries, and the most esoteric of publications.

        Stop in for a hot beverageâ€”stick around for lost French translations of Howard Zinn!

        Sincerely,

        Your Friends at Books n' Beans

        123 Main Street, Northampton, MA 01060 | Phone: 413.555.5555

        Open Monday - Saturday from 7am to 10pm | Sunday from 8am to 6pm</p>
